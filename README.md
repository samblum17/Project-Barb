- Chooses quote based on selected widget size (available in small, medium, and large configurations)
- Automatically adapts theme to light and dark mode
- Delivers a throwback to the past with a stunning retro theme

Whether you're a Steve enthusiast, looking for some daily motivation, or both, - Steve is designed to enhance your home screen and inspire your creativity.

## Prerequisites
- Steve is an iOS Application that is designed to run on iOS 14+ 

## Development Process
Codenamed "Project Barb", - Steve was built with the objectives of learning WidgetKit and continuing to sharpen SwiftUI skills. Though it did not land on the App Store, - Steve is fully fledged out and sits beautifully on the home screen. Using a Notion workspace, I managed a kanban board for the project from start to finish over a 6 day period following strict deadlines and priorities to practice project management methodoligies. Project Barb also utilized Git and GitHub for source control. The quotations are stored in a JSON file with the repository, and the widget intelligently pulled a random item from the JSON tree to display and update in the app. The state of retro mode is managed using UserDefaults and the new @AppStorage property in SwiftUI/Xcode 12.0+. The app was fully tested and reviewed before completion.

This application was designed, developed, and tested entirely and solely by Sam Blum. At the time of this publication, Sam Blum is a 20 year old junior studying Computer Science and Engineering Management at Vanderbilt University. He is a lifelong Apple enthusiast and began teaching himself the Swift Programming Language for designing native iOS apps during his senior year of high school. He continued learning how to code when he took his first Java programming course at Vanderbilt in the Spring of his freshman year. In addition, he has learned fundamental software engineering principles in C++ and aims to continue developing in SwiftUI over the course of the 2020-2021 school year. Sam is currently an [Apple Developer](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/sam-blum/id1448067874) and spent the summer of 2020 as an iOS Engineer Intern at Apple. 

## Acknowledgments
I have been watching Apple's Keynotes since 2009, so I was missing Steveâ€™s legendary presentations a little extra this time of year. When Apple's October 2020 "Hi, Speed" event was announced, I was inspired to create a widget that would celebrate Steve's life and look stunning on any home screen. - Steve, a.k.a "Project Barb" was born.
I would like to thank Apple for the abundance of documentation and resources on building my first widget. I would like to thank Anshul Joshi for inspiring the quote generator idea. And finally, as always, I'd like to thank my family for pushing me to continue learning and working hard, even when it gets tough. 
Grit, humility, and a constant drive to never be satisfied push me to seek new opportunities every day. I'm extremely proud of the special place this project will hold in my heart, and I look forward to creating many more widgets in the coming months. Thank you for checking out - Steve, and have a great day!
